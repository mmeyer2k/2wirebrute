2wirebrute
==========

2wire routers ship with a default password scheme that is vulnerable to brute
force attack within a reasonable amount of time on modest hardware. Passwords
are 10 digit numeric which yields a mere 10 billion possibilities.

2wirebrute is a simple tool for outputting potential default passwords for use
in programs like aircrack-ng.
